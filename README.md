kitum:humanitarian activism

KitHum is a platform that aims to help digital citizens to get training on digital humanitarian volunteering and coordination.  The name "Kitum" came from Wounaan Indigenous language and means "IÂ´m here for you" 

The tool helps to make profiles of users and help them to improve their training based on five profiles. "Spider", "Narrator", "Leader" and "Geek". A new profile "Humanitarian" is being considered to be added to the list. 

The users must register and then test their interests and capacities in order to the system to advice the learning route for each user. 

Also some networking features are desirables.
